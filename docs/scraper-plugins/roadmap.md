# Scraper Plugin System — Enhancement Roadmap

Detailed implementation plans for each milestone live in
[`test-plan/scraper-plugins/`](../../test-plan/scraper-plugins/).

| # | Milestone | Status |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Remove Built-ins, Add Startup Seeding | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Dry-run Test Endpoint | ✅ Done |
| 3 | dryRun Flag on Run-Now | ⬜ Not Started |
| 4 | Plugin Input Schema | ⬜ Not Started |

---

## Milestone 1 — Remove Built-ins, Add Startup Seeding

**Goal:** Eliminate bank-specific knowledge from the NestJS core. All scrapers —
including the current CIBC and TD implementations — load through the same plugin
path, making them swappable without a redeploy.

### Key Changes

- Remove `CibcScraper` and `TdScraper` from `scraper.module.ts` providers and the
  `BANK_SCRAPER` factory provider.
- Delete (or relocate) the DI-only class wrappers in `banks/cibc.scraper.ts` and
  `banks/td.scraper.ts`; keep the scraping logic as standalone `.js` plugin files
  bundled with the distribution.
- Extend `ScraperPluginLoader.onModuleInit()` with a seeding step that runs before
  `loadPlugins()`:
  - Resolves the built-in plugin source paths (relative to the compiled output).
  - Copies each file into `SCRAPER_PLUGIN_DIR` if it does not already exist there
    (idempotent — never overwrites an operator-modified version).
  - Logs a `skip` message when the file is already present.

### Files Affected

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `packages/backend/src/scraper/scraper.module.ts` | Remove `CibcScraper`, `TdScraper` imports and `BANK_SCRAPER` factory provider |
| `packages/backend/src/scraper/banks/cibc.scraper.ts` | Convert to a standalone ESM plugin (no NestJS DI); keep `BankScraper` default export |
| `packages/backend/src/scraper/banks/td.scraper.ts` | Same conversion as CIBC |
| `packages/backend/src/scraper/scraper.plugin-loader.ts` | Add `seedBuiltins()` step before `loadPlugins()` |
| `packages/backend/src/scraper/__TEST__/scraper.plugin-loader.spec.ts` | Add seeding tests (idempotency, copy-on-missing) |

### Decision Notes

- **Startup hook over Prisma seed:** Seeding is handled entirely inside
  `ScraperPluginLoader.onModuleInit()`. This keeps filesystem concerns in the
  scraper module, runs automatically on every boot (including Docker), and
  requires no manual operator steps (`npm run seed`).
- `ScraperRegistry` already accepts an empty `BANK_SCRAPER` injection via
  `@Optional()` (see `scraper.registry.ts` line 21) — removing the factory
  provider requires no further registry changes.
- One code path for all scrapers means the admin `reload` and `install` endpoints
  already cover built-ins with no extra work.

---

## Milestone 2 — Dry-run Test Endpoint

**Goal:** Give plugin developers a way to inspect raw scraper output without
writing any data to the database.

### Key Changes

- Add `POST /admin/scrapers/:bankId/test` to `ScraperAdminController`.
  - Guard: `JwtAuthGuard` + `AdminGuard` (ADMIN role only).
  - Request body: `TestScraperDto` — `inputs: Record<string, string>`, `lookbackDays`.
  - Behaviour: decrypt credentials, run the full scrape through `ScraperService`
    (or a new `ScraperAdminService` method), skip the `prisma.transaction.createMany`
    call, and return the raw `RawTransaction[]`.
  - Response shape: `{ bankId: string; transactions: RawTransaction[]; count: number }`.
- Add `TestScraperDto` and `TestScraperResponseDto` in
  `scraper/admin/dto/`.

### Files Affected

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `packages/backend/src/scraper/scraper-admin.controller.ts` | Add `POST /:bankId/test` action |
| `packages/backend/src/scraper/scraper-admin.service.ts` | Add `testScraper(bankId, dto)` method |
| `packages/backend/src/scraper/admin/dto/test-scraper.dto.ts` | New — request body DTO |
| `packages/backend/src/scraper/admin/dto/test-scraper-response.dto.ts` | New — response DTO |
| `packages/backend/src/scraper/__TEST__/scraper-admin.service.spec.ts` | Extend with test-scraper cases |
| `packages/backend/src/scraper/__TEST__/scraper-admin.controller.spec.ts` | Extend with test-scraper cases |

### Decision Notes

- The endpoint runs in the main process using a direct scraper call rather than
  spawning a worker thread — avoids SSE plumbing for a synchronous dev tool.
- Returns `404` if `bankId` is not registered in `ScraperRegistry`.
- Inputs are not persisted; they are passed directly to the scraper's
  `login()` method and discarded after the call.

### Recommended Next Actions

#### Step 1 — Plan

```
@docs/scraper-plugins/roadmap.md

planner — Produce a full implementation plan for Milestone 2 — Dry-run Test
Endpoint. Research the existing scraper admin patterns before writing anything:
read scraper-admin.controller.ts, scraper-admin.service.ts, and their spec
files to understand the established conventions for guards, DTOs, and service
method signatures. Then read bank-scraper.interface.ts to understand
RawTransaction and how login() receives inputs. Save the plan to
test-plan/scraper-plugins/milestone-2-implementation-plan.md.

The plan must cover:
- TestScraperDto shape: inputs (Record<string, string>), lookbackDays (number,
  optional, defaults to plugin maxLookbackDays)
- TestScraperResponseDto shape: bankId, transactions (RawTransaction[]), count
- ScraperAdminService.testScraper(bankId, dto): resolve the plugin from
  ScraperRegistry (404 if absent), call login() then scrapeTransactions() with
  a real Playwright page, return raw results without writing to the database
- Controller action: POST /admin/scrapers/:bankId/test, JwtAuthGuard +
  AdminGuard, 200 on success, 404 if bankId unknown
- How to open and close the Playwright browser within the service method
  (reference how ScraperService or the worker does it today)
- Unit test cases for the service (happy path, 404, login error, scrape error)
  and controller (guard behaviour, response shape delegation)
```

#### Step 2 — Implement

```
@docs/scraper-plugins/roadmap.md
@test-plan/scraper-plugins/milestone-2-implementation-plan.md

backend-dev — Implement Milestone 2 — Dry-run Test Endpoint using the plan
above. Follow all backend conventions: # path aliases, .js ESM extensions on
internal imports, class-validator decorators on DTOs, @ApiProperty on all DTO
fields. Do not spawn a worker thread — run the scrape synchronously in the main
process. After implementing, run npm run typecheck and npm run lint to confirm
the build is clean before finishing.
```

#### Step 3 — Tests

```
@docs/scraper-plugins/roadmap.md
@test-plan/scraper-plugins/milestone-2-implementation-plan.md

test-writer — Extend scraper-admin.service.spec.ts and
scraper-admin.controller.spec.ts with Milestone 2 test cases. Read both spec
files in full before writing anything — match the existing mock setup, factory
patterns, and assertion style exactly.

Service cases to cover:
- Happy path: login() and scrapeTransactions() called; raw results returned
- bankId not in registry: throws NotFoundException
- login() throws: error propagates, browser closed
- scrapeTransactions() throws: error propagates, browser closed

Controller cases to cover:
- 200 with correct response shape delegated from service
- No auth token: 401
- Non-admin user: 403
- Service throws NotFoundException: 404

Run the full spec suite after writing and fix any failures before finishing.
```

#### Step 4 — Live API Testing

```
@docs/scraper-plugins/roadmap.md
@test-plan/scraper-plugins/milestone-2-implementation-plan.md

backend-tester — Run the Milestone 2 API test plan against the running server
at http://localhost:3001. Save the test plan to
test-plan/scraper-plugins/milestone-2-backend.md and the execution report to
test-plan/scraper-plugins/milestone-2-backend-report.md.

Test cases to execute:
- POST /admin/scrapers/:bankId/test — no auth token → 401
- POST /admin/scrapers/:bankId/test — USER role → 403
- POST /admin/scrapers/unknown-bank/test — ADMIN token → 404
- POST /admin/scrapers/cibc/test — ADMIN token, valid inputs → 200 with
  { bankId, transactions, count } shape (do not assert transaction content —
  a real browser session is not available in CI; assert shape only)
```

#### Step 5 — Code Review

```
@docs/scraper-plugins/roadmap.md
@test-plan/scraper-plugins/milestone-2-implementation-plan.md

code-reviewer — Review the Milestone 2 changes in packages/backend/src/scraper/.
Focus on: guard ordering on the new controller action, correct Playwright
browser lifecycle (browser always closed in finally), DTO validation coverage,
error propagation from login() and scrapeTransactions(), and whether the
service method could leak a browser handle if an unexpected exception is thrown.
Also confirm the response DTO is fully decorated with @ApiProperty so the
OpenAPI spec stays accurate.
```

#### Step 6 — Commit

```
@docs/scraper-plugins/roadmap.md

backend-dev — Commit the Milestone 2 changes with message:
feat(scraper): add dry-run test endpoint POST /admin/scrapers/:bankId/test
```

## Milestone 3 — dryRun Flag on Run-Now

**Goal:** Allow end-to-end testing of the full sync pipeline — including the
worker thread, SSE events, and MFA flow — without committing any transactions to
the database.

### Key Changes

- Add `dryRun?: boolean` (default `false`) to `RunSyncNowDto`
  (`packages/backend/src/scraper/sync/dto/run-sync-now.dto.ts`).
- Thread the flag through `ScraperService.sync()` → `ScraperWorkerInput` →
  the worker thread.
- In the worker thread, gate the `prisma.transaction.createMany` call behind
  `if (!input.dryRun)`.
- The SSE stream emits all normal status events including the terminal
  `complete` event; the `importedCount` in a dry-run response will be `0`
  and `skippedCount` will reflect what would have been deduped.
- Add `dryRun: boolean` to `ScraperWorkerInput` in
  `bank-scraper.interface.ts`.

### Files Affected

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `packages/backend/src/scraper/sync/dto/run-sync-now.dto.ts` | Add `dryRun?: boolean` field |
| `packages/backend/src/scraper/interfaces/bank-scraper.interface.ts` | Add `dryRun: boolean` to `ScraperWorkerInput` |
| `packages/backend/src/scraper/scraper.service.ts` | Pass `dryRun` into worker input |
| `packages/backend/src/scraper/scraper.worker.ts` | Gate `createMany` on `!input.dryRun` |
| `packages/backend/src/scraper/__TEST__/scraper.service.spec.ts` | Add dry-run cases |
| `packages/backend/src/scraper/__TEST__/scraper.worker.spec.ts` | Add dry-run cases |

### Decision Notes

- Result is returned via SSE as normal — no new endpoint or response shape
  needed; the caller distinguishes dry-run from a real run by the flag it
  passed, not by the response format.
- DB write is the only step skipped; deduplication logic still runs against
  existing `Transaction.fitid` values so `skippedCount` is accurate.

---

## Milestone 4 — Plugin Input Schema

**Goal:** Allow plugin authors to declare any inputs their plugin needs from
the user — authentication fields, account selectors, configuration values, or
anything else. The platform stores and passes inputs as opaque encrypted JSON;
it does not interpret or constrain the field set. The frontend renders the
correct form dynamically from the schema with no hardcoded field lists.

### Key Changes

#### Backend

- Add `PluginFieldDescriptor` interface and replace `BankCredentials` with
  `PluginInputs = Record<string, string>` in `bank-scraper.interface.ts`:
  ```typescript
  interface PluginFieldDescriptor {
      key: string;           // field name in stored JSON
      label: string;         // shown in the UI form
      type: 'text' | 'password' | 'select' | 'number';
      required: boolean;
      hint?: string;         // optional helper text below the field
      options?: string[];    // values for type: 'select'
  }
  ```
- Add `inputSchema: PluginFieldDescriptor[]` as a **required** field on
  `BankScraper`. Update `isBankScraper` type guard to check for its presence.
- Update CIBC and TD plugins to declare their `inputSchema`:
  ```typescript
  inputSchema: [
      { key: 'username', label: 'Username', type: 'text',     required: true },
      { key: 'password', label: 'Password', type: 'password', required: true },
  ]
  ```
- Extend `ScraperInfoDto` and `GET /scrapers` response to include `inputSchema`
  per entry so the frontend always has the full field descriptor available.
- Update `CreateSyncScheduleDto`: replace `username` + `password` fields with
  `inputs: Record<string, string>`. Validate that all `required: true` keys
  from the plugin's registered `inputSchema` are present in the submitted
  `inputs` object (dynamic cross-field validation against the registry).
- Update `UpdateSyncScheduleDto`: replace `username?` + `password?` with
  `inputs?: Record<string, string>` (partial update — absent means unchanged).
- Rename `credentials_enc` → `plugin_config_enc` in the Prisma schema
  (one-column rename migration; no data migration needed — column is opaque
  encrypted JSON).
- Update `CryptoService` callers to use the renamed column.

#### Frontend

- Regenerate Orval types after backend OpenAPI update:
  - `scraperInfoDto.ts` gains `inputSchema: PluginFieldDescriptor[]`
  - `createSyncScheduleDto.ts` replaces `username`/`password` with `inputs`
  - `updateSyncScheduleDto.ts` same replacement
- Update `SyncScheduleFormValues` in `scraper.types.ts`: drop `username` and
  `password`; add `inputs: Record<string, string>`.
- Update `useSyncSchedule.ts`:
  - `openCreate()` initialises `inputs: {}`
  - `openEdit()` resets `inputs: {}` (stored inputs are never transmitted back)
  - Validation checks that all `required: true` keys in the selected plugin's
    `inputSchema` have a non-empty value in `inputs`
- Replace hardcoded username/password fields in `SyncScheduleForm.tsx` with a
  loop over the selected plugin's `inputSchema`:
  - `type: 'text'` → `<input type="text">`
  - `type: 'password'` → `<input type="password">`
  - `type: 'number'` → `<input type="number">`
  - `type: 'select'` + `options` → `<select>`
  - `hint` → helper text rendered below the field
  - `required: true` → field is marked required and blocks form submission

| `packages/backend/src/scraper/__TEST__/create-sync-schedule.dto.spec.ts` | Replace credential field tests with `inputs` validation tests |

#### Frontend

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `packages/frontend/src/api/model/scraperInfoDto.ts` | Regenerated — gains `inputSchema` |
| `packages/frontend/src/api/model/createSyncScheduleDto.ts` | Regenerated — `inputs` replaces `username`/`password` |
| `packages/frontend/src/api/model/updateSyncScheduleDto.ts` | Regenerated — `inputs?` replaces `username?`/`password?` |
| `packages/frontend/src/features/scraper/types/scraper.types.ts` | `SyncScheduleFormValues`: drop `username`/`password`; add `inputs: Record<string, string>` |
| `packages/frontend/src/features/scraper/hooks/useSyncSchedule.ts` | Update `openCreate`, `openEdit`, and validation to use `inputs` + `inputSchema` |
| `packages/frontend/src/features/scraper/components/SyncScheduleForm.tsx` | Replace hardcoded credential fields with `inputSchema`-driven render loop |

### Decision Notes

- **No fixed credential taxonomy.** There is no `browser | api_token | api_key`
  union. The plugin declares exactly what it needs — a password field, an
  account number, a region selector, a list of sub-accounts — with no platform
  constraint on field count or meaning.
- **Dynamic validation without hardcoding.** The DTO validates `inputs` by
  looking up the plugin's `inputSchema` from `ScraperRegistry` at request time.
  Required field enforcement is driven by the schema, not by static DTO
  decorators.
- **One form component for all plugins.** `SyncScheduleForm.tsx` renders
  entirely from `inputSchema`. A newly installed plugin with novel fields works
  immediately — no frontend changes required.
- **Column rename is the only migration.** `credentials_enc` → `plugin_config_enc`
  is a rename only; the column type and existing encrypted JSON values are
  unchanged. Existing rows remain valid.
- **Edit mode behaviour unchanged.** Stored inputs are never transmitted back
  to the client. On edit, `inputs` resets to `{}` — the user must re-enter
  values they wish to change, identical to the current username/password
  behaviour.
- **`inputs` value-type validation:** `TestScraperDto.inputs` uses `@IsObject()` which validates that the field is a plain object but does not validate that record values are strings — a caller can send `{"inputs": {"username": 123}}` and it passes validation. This gap is intentionally deferred to Milestone 4. When `BankCredentials` is replaced with `PluginInputs = Record<string, string>`, introduce a custom `@IsStringRecord()` validator (or a `@ValidateNested` + `@Transform` equivalent) on any DTO that accepts `inputs` or `Record<string, string>` fields so value types are enforced at the HTTP boundary.
