# Frontend Test Plan: Transactions (Phase 3)

**Feature**: Transactions page — list, filter, CRUD, summary, pagination  
**Route**: `/transactions`  
**Coverage level**: Full regression  
**Agent**: frontend-tester

---

## Preconditions

- [ ] Vite dev server running at `http://localhost:5173`
- [ ] NestJS backend running at `http://localhost:3001`
- [ ] A registered test user exists: `test@example.com` / `password123`
- [ ] At least one existing transaction in the database (for edit/delete/toggle cases)
- [ ] At least 51 transactions exist (for pagination case TC-17)

---

## Test Cases

### Authentication & Access

#### TC-01: Unauthenticated access redirects to login
- **Type**: Smoke
- **Steps**:
  1. Clear all cookies and localStorage (start logged out)
  2. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/transactions`
- **Expected result**: Redirected to `/login`; Transactions page is not rendered

---

### Page Load

#### TC-02: Page renders for authenticated user
- **Type**: Smoke
- **Steps**:
  1. Log in as `test@example.com`
  2. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/transactions`
  3. Wait for data to load; take screenshot — verify sections appear in this order: page header (`.tx-page__header`) → summary bar (`.tx-summary`) → filter bar (`.tx-filters`) → transaction table (`.tx-list`) → pagination; table has visible column headers (Date, Description, Amount, Category, Actions); filter bar is not overlapping the table; summary values are not clipped or overflowing their container
  4. Call `browser_console_messages(level: 'error')` — confirm no JS errors
- **Expected result**: Page heading "Transactions" is visible; "+ Add Transaction" button is present; filter bar is visible; structural layout is intact; no JS errors in console

#### TC-03: Loading state shown while fetching
- **Type**: Regression
- **Steps**:
  1. Log in and navigate to `/transactions`
  2. Observe the moment the page first loads (before data arrives)
- **Expected result**: A loading spinner or skeleton is shown while the API call is in flight

#### TC-04: Empty state shown when user has no transactions
- **Type**: Regression
- **Steps**:
  1. Log in as a user with zero transactions
  2. Navigate to `/transactions`
- **Expected result**: An empty-state message is displayed; the list area does not show a broken layout

#### TC-05: Error state shown when API is unreachable
- **Type**: Edge Case
- **Steps**:
  1. Stop the backend server
  2. Navigate to `/transactions` (token already in localStorage)
- **Expected result**: An error message is displayed; no blank screen or unhandled exception

#### TC-35: Category column visible in table on page load
- **Type**: Smoke
- **Steps**:
  1. Log in and navigate to `/transactions`
  2. Call `browser_network_requests` — verify `GET /categories` returned 200
  3. Take screenshot — verify CATEGORY column header is visible in the table; at least one row shows a colour swatch and category name in its CATEGORY cell
- **Expected result**: CATEGORY column header present; cells show swatch + name for transactions with a category assigned, "—" for unassigned; `GET /categories` fires once on page load

---

### Summary Bar

#### TC-06: Summary displays income, expenses, and net totals
- **Type**: Regression
- **Steps**:
  1. Log in and navigate to `/transactions`
  2. Observe the summary bar
- **Expected result**: Three values shown — Income (positive), Expenses (negative), Net; values are non-zero when transactions exist for the current date range

#### TC-07: Summary updates when date range filter changes
- **Type**: Regression
- **Steps**:
  1. Navigate to `/transactions`
  2. Change the date range filter to "This Year"
  3. Compare totals to the "This Month" totals
- **Expected result**: Summary totals change to reflect the new date range

---

### Filters

#### TC-08: Date range preset "This Month" filters list
- **Type**: Smoke
- **Subject control**: "This Month" preset button
- **Steps**:
  1. Navigate to `/transactions`
  2. In the DateRangePicker, select the "This Month" preset
- **Expected result**: List updates to show only transactions within the current calendar month; pagination resets to page 1

#### TC-08a: Date range preset "Today" — subject: Today button
- **Type**: Regression
- **Subject control**: "Today" preset button
- **Steps**:
  1. Navigate to `/transactions`
  2. Click the "Today" preset button
  3. Inspect the URL query string — note `startDate` and `endDate` values
  4. Call `browser_network_requests` — verify `GET /transactions` was called
- **Expected result**: `startDate` equals today's UTC midnight (`T00:00:00.000Z`); `endDate` equals today's UTC end-of-day (`T23:59:59.999Z`); "Today" button has `aria-pressed="true"`; list shows only today's transactions (or empty state if none exist for today); pagination resets to page 1
- **Note**: If no transactions exist for today, an empty-state message must be shown — a zero-row table without an empty-state message is also a failure

#### TC-08b: Date range preset "This Week" — subject: This Week button
- **Type**: Regression
- **Subject control**: "This Week" preset button
- **Steps**:
  1. Navigate to `/transactions`
  2. Click the "This Week" preset button

  4. Call `browser_network_requests` — verify `GET /transactions` was called
- **Expected result**: `startDate` equals the UTC midnight of Monday for the current ISO week; `endDate` equals the UTC end-of-day of the following Sunday; "This Week" button has `aria-pressed="true"`; list shows only transactions in that ISO-week range; pagination resets to page 1

#### TC-08c: Date range preset "This Year" — positive path — subject: This Year button
- **Type**: Regression
- **Subject control**: "This Year" preset button
- **Known failing**: BUG-02 — `startDate` is not emitted; only `endDate` is set. This TC will PARTIAL/FAIL until BUG-02 is resolved
- **Steps**:
  1. Navigate to `/transactions` (default "This Month" preset active)
  2. Click the "This Year" preset button
  3. Inspect the URL query string — note both `startDate` and `endDate` values
  4. Call `browser_network_requests` — verify `GET /transactions` was called
- **Expected result**: `startDate` equals `YYYY-01-01T00:00:00.000Z` (Jan 1 of current year); `endDate` equals `YYYY-12-31T23:59:59.999Z` (Dec 31 of current year); "This Year" button has `aria-pressed="true"`; list includes transactions from earlier in the year (not just the current month); pagination resets to page 1
- **Current behaviour (BUG-02)**: URL contains only `endDate`; `startDate` from the previous "This Month" preset is not reset. TC will be marked ⚠️ PARTIAL until fixed

#### TC-09: Custom date range filters list
- **Type**: Regression
- **Subject control**: "Custom" preset / date range inputs
- **Steps**:
  1. Navigate to `/transactions`
  2. Select "Custom" in the DateRangePicker

- **Expected result**: List updates to show only matching transactions

#### TC-14: "Clear Filters" resets all filters to defaults
- **Type**: Regression
- **Steps**:
  1. Set Type to "Expense", Status to "Inactive", type something in Search
  2. Click the "Clear Filters" button
- **Expected result**: Type → "All Types", Status → "Active", Search → empty, date range → default; list refreshes

#### TC-36: Category filter — select existing category filters the list
- **Type**: Smoke
- **Steps**:
  1. Navigate to `/transactions`
  2. Select a known category (e.g. "Food") in the Category dropdown
  3. Inspect the URL query string — verify `categoryId=<uuid>` is present
  4. Call `browser_network_requests` — verify `GET /transactions?…&categoryId=<uuid>` was called
- **Expected result**: List updates to show only transactions assigned to that category; URL contains `categoryId` param; `page` resets to 1

#### TC-37: Category filter — no matching transactions shows empty state
- **Type**: Regression
- **Steps**:
  1. Select a category that has no transactions assigned (e.g. "Produce" if unused)

## Responsive Layout

**Breakpoints in source**:
- `480px` — `TransactionsPage.css` reduces padding; `TransactionSummary.css` stacks summary items vertically; `TransactionModal.css` switches to bottom-sheet style (`position: fixed; bottom: 0; width: 100vw; border-radius` top corners only)
- `560px` — `TransactionForm.css` collapses two-column form rows to single column

**Viewports to test** (use `browser_resize` before navigating):
| Label   | Width | Height |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Desktop | 1280  | 720    |
| Tablet  | 768   | 1024   |
| Mobile  | 390   | 844    |

#### RL-03: Transactions page at mobile (390×844)
- **Type**: Regression
- **Steps**:
  1. Resize viewport to 390×844

  5. Tab through all form fields — verify all fields are reachable and not obscured by the bottom of the screen
  6. Press Escape — verify modal closes
- **Expected result**: Modal uses the `@media (max-width: 480px)` bottom-sheet style; all form fields are accessible; modal does not overflow off the bottom of the screen
